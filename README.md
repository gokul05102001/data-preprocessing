# Data preprocessing
Data Preprocessing System for Machine Learning
# Objective
This project aims to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system that tackles common data issues such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. The ultimate goal is to prepare high-quality, reliable, and usable data for machine learning applications. The preprocessing steps will help improve the performance of machine learning models by cleaning and transforming the raw data into a more structured and ready-to-use form.

# Project Overview
This repository contains code that addresses the following key tasks of data preprocessing:

Data Exploration
Data Cleaning
Data Analysis
Data Encoding
Feature Scaling
The preprocessing steps will be applied to a dataset, which you can download from this link.

# Key Components
## 1. Data Exploration (Score: 1)
Objective: Explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure and content.
Tasks:
List the unique values in each feature and calculate the length of the data for each feature.
Perform statistical analysis (mean, median, std, etc.) to understand the distribution.
Rename columns if necessary for better clarity.
## 2. Data Cleaning (Score: 2)
Objective: Handle missing or inappropriate values, duplicates, and outliers.
Tasks:
Identify missing values and treat them (removal or imputation with mean/median).
Remove duplicate rows from the dataset.
Detect and handle outliers.
Replace '0' values in the age column with NaN.
Handle null values in all columns (removal or replacement).
## 3. Data Analysis (Score: 2)
Objective: Analyze the data with specific filtering and visualization tasks.
Tasks:
Filter data where age > 40 and salary < 5000.
Create a chart to visualize the relationship between age and salary.
Count and visually represent the number of people from each location.
## 4. Data Encoding (Score: 2)
Objective: Convert categorical variables into numerical values for analysis by machine learning algorithms.
Tasks:
Apply one-hot encoding for categorical features (e.g., location).
Apply label encoding where appropriate (e.g., binary categories).
## 5. Feature Scaling (Score: 2)
Objective: Scale the features to standardize or normalize data for machine learning models.
Tasks:
Use StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to scale the features.
## Requirements
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn

Data Exploration: The script will explore the dataset, summarize the features, and rename columns if required.

Data Cleaning: The script will handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates, and apply necessary transformations like replacing zero values in the age column with NaN.

Data Analysis: The script filters the dataset based on specific conditions (e.g., age > 40 and salary < 5000) and visualizes the relationship between age and salary.

Data Encoding: Categorical variables will be encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.

Feature Scaling: The script will scale the features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

# Results
Data Exploration: Summarizes the dataset's unique values and statistical information.
Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled, duplicates removed, and outliers treated.
Data Analysis: Visualizations and counts are displayed for specific filters (e.g., age > 40, salary < 5000).
Data Encoding: Categorical features are transformed into numerical values.
Feature Scaling: Scaled features ready for machine learning models.
